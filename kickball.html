  <h1>Kickball!! Greatest Sport ever</h1>

  <h2>Introducing the greatest innovation since the rubber kickball....</h2>


  <h4>The Kickball Score Tracker</h4>
  <p>Everyone knows the feeling... It's been a long hard day at the field. 12 hours of a Kickball round robin tournament. You're sweaty. Your beer belly groans for a cold one. The last thing you want to do is manually add up those scores figure out who won with pen and paper. What year is it? You want the beautiful UI of your zsh modified terminal to spit out the winner of the literally ten's of games that were played that day. And you want to lose any record of those outcomes. It was not a good day. The beer will help, but so will.... </p>
  <h4>THE KICKBALL SCORE TRACKER</h4>
  <p>The greatest innovation since the invention of the rubber ball we all know and love.</p>
